## Portrait artist

[View deployed site here](https://ajgreaves.github.io/portrait-artist/)

A comprehensive website for a traditional portrait artist based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. 
Website features a promotional video, testimonials, a gallery of the artist's work, 
an about page, pricing tables, a clear step-by-step guide to ordering and a contact page. 
The primary goal of the website is to lead potential customers to making first contact with the
artist via the contact page. 

An important note on the longer path to buy is that unlike most B2C websites - which are emotion driven to impulse buy and have the fewest number of steps to the point of purchase -
ordering a custom portrait is an expensive and significant purchase, and one that comes with the need for more information than the average B2C purchase. 
This website tries to address the needs of the customer to find all the information that they need to make a decision to contact the artist, 
while breaking the information up into small easy to understand sections, and making the steps to the point of contact as clear and easy to follow as possible.

The business goals of this website are:
* Build brand awareness.
* Provide high quality examples of the artist's drawings and paintings.
* Drive sales in the form of first contact (via the contact page) that will then lead to a sales call with the artist. 
* Excellent UX to keep potential clients on site long enough to fill out the contact form.

The customer goals of this website are:
* Searching for high quality, bespoke artwork for their home or treasured gift. 
* Clear easy to find pricing.
* Intuitive ordering process.
 
## UX

#### Ideal client

##### The ideal client for this business is:
* English speaking.
* Has disposable income.
* Is a parent.
* Lives in the Netherlands (but can be anywhere in the world).

##### Visitors to this website are searching for:
* An artist to create a custom portrait featuring their child(ren) to decorate their home. 
* And/or a bespoke gift. 

##### This project is the best way to help them achieve these things because:
* Most artists' websites have very poor UX. 
* Other artists' websites are over complicated and produce information overload quickly. 
* This website is:
    * Easy to navigate.
    * Steps the client through easy to understand learnable information.
    * Gives the client the information they need without overloading them.
    * Guiding them to the goal of the website - to fill out the contact form.

## Features

Each page features a responsive **navigation bar** with conventional placing of **logo** (top left) and a highlighted "request a quote" button in the top right.
Each page has a **footer** with **copyright information** and **social media icons** linking to 5 the artists' social media pages. 

Every page - except the home page - features its own **hero image** at the top, detailing a drawing or painting by the artist, 
or in the case of the about page, a photo of the artist in her studio. 
The purpose of the hero image is to grab attention and give a positive emotional response to the user. 

##### Home

The Home page features a special hero image _or_ video. On mobile and tablet devices a full screen static image is seen. 
On desktops this is replaced with a promotional video, which autoplays on mute as a background element. Both of these elements have the page header displayed as an overlay.
The purpose of this hero image/video element is to give maximum impact on arriving at the website, while not using up people's data unnecessarily on mobile and tablet devices.

The home page **promotional video** hosted by Vimeo, engages the user and tells them the value of the products on offer.

After the special hero image/video is some **compelling copy** which reinforces the emotional response to the artist's work and the potential client's desire to add it to their lives.

Finally there is a simple **call to action button** guiding the user on their next step through the website - to *Visit the Gallery*.

##### About

The About page features **two photographs** of the artist in her studio, one professional headshot photograph, and a professional photograph of a painting in a fancy apartment.
The about page also includes some brief but compelling copy about the artist. 
*Enough information to satisfy curiosity without overwhelming the user*.

At the bottom of the page (above the footer) are two **call to action buttons**: *Visit Gallery* and *How to Order*. The How to Order button is highlighted. 

##### Gallery

The Gallery page is laid out in **columns of thumbnail images**, 2 columns wide for mobile devices, 3 columns wide for tablets and 6 columns wide for desktop. 
Each thumbnail is square and features a drawing or painting by the artist. 

Note: The design choice for 2 columns wide gallery preview on mobile is to encourage users to click the thumbnail and view the image in full. 
Viewing the images in full is much preferred by the artist to looking at images restricted by margins and padding. The thumbnails are still large enough to be easily clickable on mobile. 

Each can be clicked to open a **fancybox** window to view the artwork in detail, 
to move on to the next image, view the previous one, or return to the gallery page.

At the bottom of the gallery page the user is guided to choose from two **call to action buttons**: To view *Pricing* or learn *How to Order*. Again, the How to Order button is highlighted.

##### Pricing

The pricing page features **two tables**, which list example sizes of artwork and guideline prices. 
One table for drawings and a second one for paintings. The tables are displayed next to each other on desktop and tablet, and stacked on top of each other for mobiles.

Below the tables some **small print** briefly explains why the prices given are guideline only and encourages the user to request a quote for their own custom order.

At the bottom of the page the **call to action button** guides the user to learn *How to Order*.

##### How to Order

The How to Order page features the **5 numbered steps** involved in ordering a custom artwork.
Each step features a large, obvious icon, and a brief learnable explanation of the step.

Below the order timeline the user is informed how long their order is likely to take to be completed, one **timescale** each for drawings and paintings.

At the bottom of the page the **call to action button** guides the user to *Request a Quote* and they are taken to the *Contact* page.

##### Contact

The Contact page features a **contact form**, which requests client name and email, provides a place to upload a photograph, and below that a box to leave a message. 
At the bottom of the form clients can **upload** photograph(s) they want the artist to use. 

The bottom of the form contains a **Send Button**

### A note to my fellow Code Institute students

I am happy that you have come to look at my readme as an example of how to write a good one for your first Milestone project. 
You are welcome to learn how to structure and format your own readme from mine. 

However, it is not ok to copy and paste large portions of it into your own project. 
Please remember to write your own readme yourself, rather than copying mine or someone elses. 

Many thanks! Anna
